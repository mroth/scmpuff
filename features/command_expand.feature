Feature: command expansion at command line

  Background:
    Given I override the environment variables to:
      | variable | value |
      | e1       | a.txt |
      | e2       | b.txt |
      | e3       | c.txt |
      | e4       | d.txt |
      | e5       | e.txt |
      | e6       | f.txt |

  Scenario: Expand single digit case
    Important: note we check for an exact match here, because a line feed
    should not exist at the end of the output.

    When I successfully run `scmpuff expand 1`
    Then the output should contain exactly "a.txt"

  Scenario: Expand multiple digit case
    When I successfully run `scmpuff expand 1 2 6`
    Then the output should match /a.txt\tb.txt\tf.txt/

  Scenario: Expand complex case with range
    When I successfully run `scmpuff expand 6 3-4 1`
    Then the output should match /f.txt\tc.txt\td.txt\ta.txt/

  Scenario: Dont expand files or directories with numeric names
    Given an empty file named "1"
    Given a directory named "2"
    When I successfully run `scmpuff expand 3 2 1`
      Then the output should contain "c.txt"
      But the output should not contain "b.txt"
      And the output should not contain "a.txt"

  Scenario: Dont interfere with CLI "options" that are passed along after `--`
    When I successfully run `scmpuff expand -- git foo -x 1`
    Then the output should match /git\tfoo\t-x\ta.txt/

  Scenario: Make sure args with spaces get escaped on way back
    When I successfully run `scmpuff expand -- git xxx "foo bar" 1`
    Then the output should match /git\txxx\tfoo\\ bar\ta.txt/

  Scenario: Make sure args with globs get escaped on way back
    When I successfully run `scmpuff expand -- git xxx --exclude='refs/wip/*' 1`
    Then the output should contain "git	xxx	--exclude=refs/wip/\*	a.txt"

  Scenario Outline: Verify filenames with stupid characters are properly escaped
    Given I override the environment variables to:
      | variable | value      |
      | e1       | <filename> |
    When I successfully run `scmpuff expand 1`
    Then the output should contain exactly "<escaped>"
    Examples:
      | filename       | escaped          |
      | so(dumb).jpg   | so\(dumb\).jpg   |
      | hi mom.txt     | hi\ mom.txt      |
      | "x.txt         | \"x.txt          |
      | wt;af.gif      | wt\;af.gif       |
      | foo\|bar       | foo\\\|bar       |

  Scenario: Semicolons in commit messages
    Given a git repository named "whatever"
      And I cd to "whatever"
      And a 4 byte file named "a.txt"
      And I successfully run the following commands:
        | git add a.txt                               |
      When I successfully run `scmpuff expand -- git commit -m "foo; bar"`
      Then the stderr should not contain anything
        And the output should match /git\tcommit\t-m\tfoo\\;\\ bar/

  Scenario Outline: Allow user to specify --relative paths
    Given a directory named "foo"
      And a directory named "foo/bar"
      And an empty file named "xxx.jpg"
      And I cd to "foo/bar"
    Given I override environment variable "e1" to the absolute path of "xxx.jpg"
    When I successfully run `<cmd>`
    Then the output should match <output_regex>
    Examples:
      | cmd                    | output_regex                 |
      | scmpuff expand 1       | %r<^\S*/tmp/aruba/xxx\.jpg$> |
      | scmpuff expand -r -- 1 | %r<\.\./\.\./xxx\.jpg>       |

  Scenario Outline: Do not convert anything other than special variables to --relative paths
    Given a directory named "foo"
      And a directory named "foo/bar"
      And an empty file named "fakegit"
      And an empty file named "xxx.jpg"
      And I cd to "foo/bar"
    Given I override environment variable "SCMPUFF_GIT_CMD" to the absolute path of "fakegit"
      And I override environment variable "e1" to the absolute path of "xxx.jpg"
    When I successfully run `<cmd>`
    Then the output should match <output_regex>
    Examples:
      | cmd                                              | output_regex                                                  |
      | scmpuff expand -- $SCMPUFF_GIT_CMD checkout 1    | %r<^\S*/tmp/aruba/fakegit\tcheckout\t\S*/tmp/aruba/xxx\.jpg$> |
      | scmpuff expand -r -- $SCMPUFF_GIT_CMD checkout 1 | %r<^\S*/tmp/aruba/fakegit\tcheckout\t\.\./\.\./xxx\.jpg$>    |

  Scenario: Don't trim empty string args when expanding command
    There are certain situations where someone would want to actually pass an
    empty string arg, so we need to make sure we don't trim that out.
    Essentially we want to avoid the error condition reported here:
    https://github.com/ndbroadbent/scm_breeze/issues/167

    When I successfully run `scmpuff expand -- hub commit --allow-empty --allow-empty-message -m ''`
    Then the output should match /hub\tcommit\t--allow-empty\t--allow-empty-message\t-m\t\'\'/
